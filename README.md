# Flexing My Python Skills!

## Overview
Welcome to my Python Programming repository! Here, you'll find all the exciting tasks and projects I've been working on. Dive in to see my journey, code, and progress as I enhance my Python programming skills.

## About Me
Hi there! I'm Hari, a first-year Electronics and Communication Engineering student at SBMCET, Dindigul, Tamil Nadu, India. I'm passionate about technical innovation, creative expression, and technological advancement. You can connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/hari-sankar-saravanan-835768229/) to follow my journey.

## Tasks and Projects
**Task 1: Number Guessing Game**

* **Objective:** Create a simple Python-based Number guessing game.
* **Implementation:** I created a number guessing game with a Game of Thrones theme in Python. I used the `random` module to generate random messages with Game of Thrones references for incorrect guesses. The game has three levels with different ranges of numbers, maximum attempts, and hint frequencies.
* **Status:** Completed

**Task 2: Currency Converter**

* **Objective:** Create a simple Python-based Currency Converter.
* **Implementation:** I created a currency converter program in Python using the `requests` module to fetch exchange rates from an API. The program allows users to convert an amount from one currency to another. Users input the base currency, target currencies, and the amount to convert. The program fetches the exchange rates from the API and performs the conversion. It then displays the converted amount for each target currency. The program continues to run until the user decides to stop. It's a practical tool that demonstrates Python programming skills and API integration.
* **Status:** Completed

**Task 3: Password Generator**

* **Objective:** Create a simple Python-based Password Generator.
* **Implementation:** I created a password generator program in Python that offers different methods for generating passwords, including random passwords, pattern-based passwords, and passwords based on personal information. The program allows users to copy passwords to the clipboard and export them to a file. It features a straightforward menu interface for ease of use.
* **Status:** Completed

**Task 4: Alarm Clock**

* **Objective:** Create a simple Python-based Alarm Clock.
* **Implementation:** TBA
* **Status:** Incomplete
